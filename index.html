      <p class="Abstract"> Overview </p>
      <p>The widespread use of computers and networks has brought many advantages but has also introduced
        new security challenges, primarily in the form of malicious software, or malware. Malware encompasses various
        types of software designed to infiltrate systems without permission, often for financial gain. Detecting
        malicious network traffic is crucial for internet system safety, but traditional methods face difficulties with
        modern network procedures, like encryption. Deep learning offers an alternative approach for classifying network
        traffic.
      </p>
      <p>
        While there are numerous sub-categories of malware, we focus
        attention on Botnets and Ransomware. We selected Botnets out of recognition that the increasing number
        of security-vulnerable Internet of Things (IoT) devices offer an ideal
        landscape for botnets. A botnet defines a distributed network of
        computers, or bots, infected with software that enables the bots to
        be controlled by a malicious operator, or botmaster.
        Ransomware is a form of malware
        that encrypts a user’s files/devices, denying them access to these files/devices until a sum of money
        (the ransom) is paid. In 2022, there were 493 million ransomware
        attempts, a 162.29% increase since 2019.</p>
      <p>
        Existing approaches to prevent malware are not new, and they typically use Network Intrusion Detection Systems
        (NIDS). However, these methods have become less effective due to evolving networking practices. Port numbers
        and blacklisted IP addresses are no longer reliable indicators of malicious activity, and encryption protocols
        in network traffic make packet payload inspection challenging. Given these limitations, the objective is to
        assess the effectiveness of different deep learning algorithms in detecting and classifying malware traffic.

      <p class="Abstract"> Problem
        <p />
      <p> A botnet defines a distributed network of computers, or bots,
        infected with software that enables the bots to
        be controlled by a malicious operator, or botmaster. These botnets attempt to hide themselves by transmitting
        normal
        traffic amongst their botnet traffic. However, a defining charac-
        teristic of botnets is the presence of command and control channels,
        through which the malicious operator is able to transmit instructions
        or receive information. A common instruction would be a distributed
        denial-of-service (DDOS) attack, where the bots flood a target to disrupt its service. It is this characteristic
        of botnets - that the bot
        must at some point connect to its botmaster - that may be leveraged
        to build detection models. When a bot connects to the botmaster, a
        sequence of network flows, defined as a grouping of related traffic, can
        be extracted from the generated traffic, from which a deep learning
        (DL) model will be able to learn distinguishing patterns.

      <h1 class="Abstract"> Research Objectives </h1>
      <h2> Botnet Detection </h2>
      <p>
        We implement five binary classification models, an MLP, shallow CNN
        (v1), deep CNN (v2), AE, and AE+CNN, which serve as models for
        botnet detection. With respect to each classifier, we aim to:
      <ul>
        <li>Evaluate the accuracy, FPR, and FNR on the standard and proto
          zero-day test set. </li>
        <li>Evaluate how reducing the feature space, into 50% and 30%
          samples, impacts the memory requirements, inference time,
          accuracy, FPR, and FNR of the models.</li>
      </ul>
      </p>

      <h2> Botnet Classification </h2>
      <p>
        We implement five multiclass classification models, an MLP, shallow CNN
        (v1), deep CNN (v2), AE, and AE+CNN, which classify traffic into botnet families. With respect to each
        classifier, we aim to:
      <ul>
        <li>Determine the overall accuracy, and accuracy respective to each
          class, when evaluated on the standard test set.</li>
        <li>Evaluate how reducing the feature space, into 50% and 30%
          samples, effects the memory requirements and inference time,
          in relation to the overall accuracy of a model.</li>
      </ul>
      </p>

      <h1 class="Abstract"> Dataset and Preprocessing </h1>
      <p>
        The <a href="https://www.stratosphereips.org/">Stratosphere Research Laboratory</a> provides a repository
        featuring both malicious and benign traffic captures. We utilized the CTU-13 dataset, encompassing traffic from
        seven unique botnet families alongside normal traffic, all captured in PCAP format. Flow extraction from these
        PCAP files was achieved using the open-source tool, CICFlowMeter, resulting in bi-directional flows
        characterized by 84 features. These features delineate statistical packet flow details for specific sessions.
        However, certain features like IP addresses and port numbers were omitted due to their susceptibility to
        manipulation techniques like dynamic IP addressing, port-obfuscation, and IP spoofing, which impede reliable
        classification. Furthermore, to enhance model generalization on unseen data, intrinsic identity-related features
        were excluded from the training set. <br><br>

      <div class="image-container">
        <img src="Images/Pipeline.png" alt="processing pipeline" width="400" height="300">
      </div>
      <br>

      In constructing binary and multiclass datasets, network flows were systematically labelled. The binary set
      comprised 60,000 malicious instances from select botnets (Neris, Rbot, Virut, Menti, Sogou) matched with 60,000
      benign counterparts. An auxiliary zero-day dataset was curated from the Murlo and NSIS.ay botnet families to
      evaluate model robustness against novel threats.
      <br><br>

      For multiclass endeavors, a threshold of 30,000 samples per class was empirically set for classifier efficacy.
      This criterion necessitated the omission of several botnet families, notably Sogou, Menti, NSIS.ay, and Murlo. The
      refined dataset encompassed benign, Rbot, Virut, and Neris classifications, each balanced at 45,000 samples.
      Subsequently, divisions were made at a 72%, 8%, and 20% ratio for training, validation, and testing respectively.

      <h1 class="Abstract"> Experiments </h1>
      <h2> Binary Classification Experiments </h2>
      <h3> 1. Comparing the Classification Performance of Models
        Evaluated on Normal and Proto Zero-Day Test Set </h3>
      <p>This experiment establishes a baseline evaluation of how MLP, CNN
        v1, CNN v2, AE, and AE+CNN perform, in terms of classification ac-
        curacy, FPR, and FNR on the conventional testing set. Subsequently,
        these models are evaluated on the additional proto zero-day testing set, to ascertain their ability to
        generalise to unseen botnet
        families.</p>

      <h3> 2. Evaluating the Effect of a Reduced Input Feature Space
        on Computational and Classification Performance </h3>
      <p>Computational performance is defined by memory usage (MMU) and inference time (MIT). Accurate metrics are hard
        to obtain due to concurrent processes and OS memory management. We observed memory consumption increasing with
        each model iteration, risking bias towards early-evaluated models. To mitigate this, we measured MIT and MMU
        across batches of 100 test samples, rebooting the system after each batch. Memory was profiled using Python's
        'Memory Profiler' package, and inference time was measured using the 'timeit' package. Metrics were averaged
        over three runs for each model, using feature sets of 100%, 50%, and 30%.</p>
      <h2> Multiclass Classification Experiments </h2>
      <h3> 1. Evaluate the Classification Accuracy of each model over-
        all, and for each Botnet Family</h3>
      <p>The experiment tests MLP, CNN v1, CNN v2, AE, and AE+CNN models for overall and per-class accuracy in botnet
        family identification. FPRs and FNRs aren't suitable for multiclass problems. We use the standard test set only,
        dismissing proto zero-day sets as incompatible with multiclass classification. Each class is balanced with 8000
        samples, justifying the use of accuracy as a metric. Models are evaluated using Keras' 'predict()' method, and
        results are stored in a confusion matrix.</p>
      <h3>2. Evaluating the Effect of a Reduced Input Feature Space
        on Computational and Classification Performance</h3>
      <p>We evaluate the effect of reducing feature spaces on both computational and classification performance by
        training five different models on three datasets. These datasets contain 74, 37, and 22 features, which
        correspond to 100%, 50%, and 30% of the total features, respectively. For computational performance, we focus on
        measuring the model's mean inference time (MIT) and mean memory usage (MMU). Classification performance is
        primarily gauged by a model's overall accuracy across all classes. We also pay attention to the rate of
        misclassified traffic to identify whether specific models have difficulty classifying certain botnet families,
        or if some families are consistently poorly classified across all models.</p>

      <div class="centered-hr"></div>
      <h1 class="Abstract"> Results </h1>
      <h2> Binary Classification Results </h2>
      <p>
        In the evaluation of machine learning models for botnet detection, the Convolutional Neural Network version 2
        (CNN v2) outperforms both the Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) and the Autoencoder (AE). Specifically, CNN v2 shows
        the highest accuracy on a standard testing set, followed by the MLP and then the AE. While these high accuracies
        suggest that botnet detection is not exceedingly complex, the performance variations between the models are
        noteworthy.
      </p>
      <p>
        The lower performance of the AE models could be attributed to the encoding phase's inability to capture critical
        features of the input data. This limitation is particularly significant when considering high-traffic network
        environments, where even marginal error rate improvements could result in thousands of fewer false positives and
        negatives.
      </p>
      <div class="image-container">
        <img src="images/Lucas_Binary.png" alt="Image 1" style="width: 80%; height: auto;">
      </div>
      <p>
        When evaluating the models' False Positive Rate (FPR) and False Negative Rate (FNR), similar trends emerge,
        with CNN v2 demonstrating better performance overall. Interestingly, CNN v2 shows a decline in its FPR compared
        to an earlier version, which could indicate a risk of overfitting due to its increased complexity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Performance declines across all models when tested on a proto zero-day dataset, which includes botnet families
        excluded from training. This suggests that while the models are capable of high accuracy when dealing with known
        entities, their generalization to unknown families is poor. The variability in performance on the proto zero-day
        dataset further suggests that models like CNN v2, which incorporate convolutional layers, are better suited for
        capturing complex, generalized botnet behaviors. In contrast, AE and MLP models, which excel at learning
        specific features of known botnet families, struggle to generalize this knowledge to new, unknown families.
      </p>

      <h2> Multiclass Classification Results </h2>

      <table class="Lucas-Table" border="1">
        <caption>Classification and Computational Performance of Multiclass Classifiers</caption>

        <p>
          The classification and computational performance of each of the five multiclass classifiers is shown in the
          table below. The overall accuracies of the models
          when classifying traffic into respective families of Benign, Neris, Rbot,
          and Virut were expectedly lower than the binary classification task model accuracies, with a mean accuracy
          score
          across all classes of
          0.850, compared to 0.986. The best performance was observed in the
          CNN v1, which achieved an average accuracy across all families of
          0.907. We observed that there was again a marked improvement, in
          terms of overall classification accuracy, seen in the models which used
          convolutional layers, with the exception of the AE+CNN model. CNNs
          are known for their efficacy when learning hierarchical relationships
          between features, which is a useful way of reasoning about the necessary and sufficient conditions when making
          a classification.

      <p>
        We have just proposed that a CNNs’ ability to
        capture hierarchical relationships in data may be an explanation for
        their effectiveness for this problem; consequently, we suggest that
        an explanation for the relatively poor performance of the AE+CNN,
        which should benefit from this property of the convolutional layers,
        is that the encoding phase of the network reduces the complexity of
        the data to a point where the subsequent CNN is unable to learn the
        necessary hierarchical relationships, because they no longer ‘exist’ in the encoded representation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The three models that employ a CNN appeared
        to use more memory than the AE and MLP. We expect the MLP to
        use the least memory, as it is the least complex model. However, the
        CNN v1 has fewer trainable parameters than the AE, while using more
        memory. We suggest that the cause of this, and a general explanation
        for why CNNs seem to have the largest MMU, is that the CNN has to
        store filters and their respective activation maps in memory, which
        can become fairly expensive.
      </p>
      <p>
        We find that in every model, there is an increase to MMU as the
        feature space increases. This was an expected result: that larger input feature spaces are associated
        with an increase to a model’s MMU. However, we maintain that this
        increase to MMU represents a relatively small improvement to computational performance, and is often coupled
        with a fairly substantial
        improvement in classification performance.
      </p>
      <h1 class="Abstract"> Conclusion </h1>
      <p>
        For our first research objective, we found that all models
        achieved accuracies ≥0.979, FPRs ≤0.033, and FNRs ≤0.026, suggesting that the classification problem was fairly
        simple. Classification
        performance declined on the proto zero-day set overall, and clearly
        showed that CNNs were more capable algorithms at detecting zero-day
        traffic.</p>
      <p>
        We further observed a clear trend that larger feature spaces
        where associated with a larger MMU, affirming our expectation that
        feature selection might improve computational performance. However,
        in reducing feature space we also observe a substantial decline in classification performance. We found no
        evidence of a trend between feature
        space size and MIT; however, we acknowledge that there were serious
        limitations to the accuracy of measuring MIT.
      </p>

      <p>With respect to the
        second research objective, we found a fairly large differential between
        the classification performance of models which used convolutional
        layers and those that did not. We suggest that the efficacy of CNNs at
        learning hierarchical relations between features is an explanation for
        this. As with the binary classifiers, we observed a trend where larger
        feature spaces were associated with slightly greater MMU. However,
        the larger feature spaces resulted in substantially better classification
        performance.</p>

      <p class="Abstract"> Abstract </p>
      <p>A recent increase in ransomware attacks has necessitated tools that can detect threats within a computer
        network.
        Machine learning (ML) has been proposed as a solution to detect ransomware within network traffic. However,
        whilst many ML models are developed to obtain high classification accuracy, we also test their runtime memory
        performance and inference times. We further test the effect training the models on a reduced feature space has
        on the classification and computational metrics. In this study, we evaluate multi-layer perceptrons (MLP),
        1-dimensional and 2-dimensional convolutional neural networks (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM).
        Experiments are performed to give insight into each model's ability to reduce its false positives (FPs). We find
        a consistent increase in memory usage as the feature space increases and that the lowest amount of FPs is
        obtained when using 50% to 66% of the features. The study evaluates 17 models for their effectiveness in
        classifying ransomware network traffic. Efficiency in this context is considered a trade-off between accuracy,
        false positives, runtime memory usage, and inference time.</p>

      The OA dataset includes over 120 hours of ransomware traffic, comprising 94 samples from 43 different ransomware
      families, some of which have multiple samples. The dataset spans from 2015 to 2021, with varying packet counts and
      traffic durations among samples.
      <br>
      <br>
      The benign dataset in OA consists of normal network traffic generated by approximately 300 users on a campus
      network over one week, excluding weekends. Each day's traffic is segregated into its own subset.
      <br>
      <br>
      For modeling purposes, the data is divided into four groups: the train set, validation set, test set, and extra
      test set. These subsets include both benign and ransomware network traffic, except for the extra test set, which
      exclusively contains benign traffic for false positive testing. The test set contains previously unseen network
      traffic but also includes ransomware from the same families present in the train set.

      <p>The LSTM model outperforms others in accuracy, thanks to its ability to handle sequential network traffic,
        learn long-term dependencies, and deal with noisy data. However, the windowed LSTM (WLSTM) didn't perform as
        well due to reduced temporal resolution. The 2D CNN had the worst accuracy but the fewest false positives (FPs),
        indicating it may capture spatial patterns in benign traffic, while MLP had a higher accuracy but more FPs,
        likely due to dataset imbalance. LSTM handles class imbalance better.

        Regarding inference time and runtime memory usage, MLP is the fastest (0.0023 ms) and LSTM is the slowest
        (0.0089 ms). This aligns with MLP's lightweight architecture. CNNs perform similarly, with LSTM using the least
        runtime memory. WLSTM is less memory-efficient due to windowed processing, but this trade-off can lead to faster
        inference times. All models have acceptable inference times below 25.74 milliseconds.

        In the analysis of model performance with varying numbers of input features (5, 15, 20, 30), it's observed that
        using all features results in high accuracies, but there's no consistent trend across all models when using
        fewer
        features. Surprisingly, the LSTM consistently maintains high accuracy with different feature counts, contrary to
        previous expectations.
        <br>
        <br>
        Concerning false positives (FPs), there's a "sweet spot" for all models, with the lowest FPs occurring when
        using
        15-20 features. This suggests that too few features may hinder learning, while using all features could
        introduce
        redundancy and confusion.
        <br>
        <br>
        MLP stands out by performing well with just five features, indicating its effectiveness with fewer inputs.
        However, models that yield low FPs but struggle to classify ransomware, like the 2D CNN, are less useful. In
        contrast, the LSTM maintains high accuracy even with 20 features.
        <br>
        <br>
        When considering runtime memory usage, as more features are used, it consistently increases across all models,
        aligning with prior research. Inference time changes slightly with different feature counts, with the LSTM being
        the slowest and the MLP the fastest. However, the number of features does not strongly influence inference time.
        <br>
        <br>
        In summary, varying input feature sizes impact accuracy, FPs, and runtime memory usage. The LSTM performs well
        across different input sizes, suggesting the sequential nature of network packet data. The optimal range for
        minimizing FPs is using 50% to 66% of the feature set. Larger inputs lead to increased runtime memory usage.

      <p class="Abstract"> Conclusion </p>
      <p>In conclusion, this study evaluated the performance of various ML models for classifying encrypted network
        traffic as ransomware.
        <br>
        <br>
        We found that there is no universally perfect model, and the choice should align with specific network
        requirements. Additionally, we observed that the number of features inputted into a model affects model
        performance, with the 20-feature LSTM model consistently performing well. Dimensionality reduction did not
        greatly impact inference time but increased runtime memory usage. Lastly, combining a sliding window of inputs
        with an LSTM did not yield favourable results. Our findings emphasize the need for tailored model selection,
        optimized input sizes, and carefully designed feature sets for effective ransomware detection in encrypted
        network traffic.
        <br>
        <br>
        For future work, network traffic could be collected from multiple networks to make the models more generalisable
        to different network environments. Secondly, to further investigate dimensionality reduction, rather than
        exclusively selecting the first x features, future studies could involve randomly selecting features to assess
        the significance of feature quantity versus feature selection. Extending dimensionality reduction experiments to
        different network traffic datasets can also test whether similar effects manifest across various datasets. To
        reduce the inaccuracies when measuring runtime memory usage and inference time, future work could further
        include measuring these metrics in a more isolated environment, where these metrics can easily be controlled.
