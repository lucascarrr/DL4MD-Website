      <h1 class="Abstract"> Problem </h1>

      <p> A botnet defines a distributed network of computers, or bots,
        infected with software that enables the bots to
        be controlled by a malicious operator, or botmaster. These botnets attempt to hide themselves by transmitting
        normal
        traffic amongst their botnet traffic. However, a defining charac-
        teristic of botnets is the presence of command and control channels,
        through which the malicious operator is able to transmit instructions
        or receive information. A common instruction would be a distributed
        denial-of-service (DDOS) attack, where the bots flood a target to disrupt its service. It is this characteristic
        of botnets - that the bot
        must at some point connect to its botmaster - that may be leveraged
        to build detection models. When a bot connects to the botmaster, a
        sequence of network flows, defined as a grouping of related traffic, can
        be extracted from the generated traffic, from which a deep learning
        (DL) model will be able to learn distinguishing patterns.

      <h1 class="Abstract"> Research Objectives </h1>
      <p>
        We implement five binary classification models, an MLP, shallow CNN
        (v1), deep CNN (v2), AE, and AE+CNN, which serve as models for
        botnet detection. With respect to each classifier, we aim to:
      <ul>
        <li>Evaluate the accuracy, FPR, and FNR on the standard and proto
          zero-day test set. </li>
        <li>Evaluate how reducing the feature space, into 50% and 30%
          samples, impacts the memory requirements, inference time,
          accuracy, FPR, and FNR of the models.</li>
      </ul>
      </p>

      <h1 class="Abstract"> Dataset and Preprocessing </h1>
      <p>
        The <a href="https://www.stratosphereips.org/">Stratosphere Research Laboratory</a> provides a repository
        featuring both malicious and benign traffic captures. We utilized the CTU-13 dataset, encompassing traffic from
        seven unique botnet families alongside normal traffic, all captured in PCAP format. Flow extraction from these
        PCAP files was achieved using the open-source tool, CICFlowMeter, resulting in bi-directional flows
        characterized by 84 features. These features delineate statistical packet flow details for specific sessions.
        However, certain features like IP addresses and port numbers were omitted due to their susceptibility to
        manipulation techniques like dynamic IP addressing, port-obfuscation, and IP spoofing, which impede reliable
        classification. Furthermore, to enhance model generalization on unseen data, intrinsic identity-related features
        were excluded from the training set. <br><br>

      <br>

      In constructing binary and multiclass datasets, network flows were systematically labelled. The binary set
      comprised 60,000 malicious instances from select botnets (Neris, Rbot, Virut, Menti, Sogou) matched with 60,000
      benign counterparts. An auxiliary zero-day dataset was curated from the Murlo and NSIS.ay botnet families to
      evaluate model robustness against novel threats.

      <br> <br>

      For multiclass endeavors, a threshold of 30,000 samples per class was empirically set for classifier efficacy.
      This criterion necessitated the omission of several botnet families, notably Sogou, Menti, NSIS.ay, and Murlo. The
      refined dataset encompassed benign, Rbot, Virut, and Neris classifications, each balanced at 45,000 samples.
      Subsequently, divisions were made at a 72%, 8%, and 20% ratio for training, validation, and testing respectively.
