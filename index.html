      <p class="Abstract"> Abstract </p>

      <p>Detection of malicious traffic on a network is critical to ensuring the
        safety and security of internet systems. Classical approaches to this
        task increasingly struggle with modern networking procedures, like
        encryption. Deep learning (DL) offers an alternative approach to traffic
        classification problems.We address two major problem classes: (1) botnet
        detection and (2) botnet family classification. For each problem, we
        explore five implementations of DL architectures: a multi-layer perceptron
        (MLP), shallow and deep convolutional neural network (CNN v1
        and CNN v2), an autoencoder (AE) and an autoencoder + convolutional
        neural network (AE+CNN). We recognise a lack of surrounding literature
        which consider the computational requirements as an important
        aspect of model evaluation. Consequently, our evaluation of models
        for each respective problem class is based on the classification and
        computational performance of each model. We further investigate the
        effect of training the models on an input with a reduced feature space,
        where we discuss the impact this has in terms of a trade-off between
        computational and classification performance. For botnet detection,
        we find that all models attain good (≥ 0.979 accuracy) classification
        performance on a normal testing set; however, this performance drops
        fairly significantly when evaluated on a set of unknown botnet families.
        Furthermore, we observed a clear trend between increased feature
        space and memory utilisation, while finding no evidence of a trend
        inference time and feature space. For botnet classification, we found
        that models which implement CNN architectures outperform others
        by a significant margin (≈ 6 percentage points). We observe the same
        trend between feature space and memory utilisation, and absence of
        apparent relationship between feature space and inference time.</p>

      <p class="Abstract"> Abstract </p>
      <p>A recent increase in ransomware attacks has necessitated tools that can detect threats within a computer
        network.
        Machine learning (ML) has been proposed as a solution to detect ransomware within network traffic. However,
        whilst many ML models are developed to obtain high classification accuracy, we also test their runtime memory
        performance and inference times. We further test the effect training the models on a reduced feature space has
        on the classification and computational metrics. In this study, we evaluate multi-layer perceptrons (MLP),
        1-dimensional and 2-dimensional convolutional neural networks (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM).
        Experiments are performed to give insight into each model's ability to reduce its false positives (FPs). We find
        a consistent increase in memory usage as the feature space increases and that the lowest amount of FPs is
        obtained when using 50% to 66% of the features. The study evaluates 17 models for their effectiveness in
        classifying ransomware network traffic. Efficiency in this context is considered a trade-off between accuracy,
        false positives, runtime memory usage, and inference time.</p>
      <p class="Abstract"> Research Objectives </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Assess the performance of MLP, 1D CNN, 2D CNN, and LSTM models in classifying encrypted network traffic as benign or ransomware, considering the accuracy, false positive/negative rate, inference time, and runtime memory usage of the models.</li>
        <li>Investigate the impact of using a window of samples on the accuracy, false positive rate, inference time, and runtime memory consumption on an LSTM by grouping multiple samples into one sample.</li>
        <li>Investigate the impact of dimensionality reduction on accuracy, false positive rate, inference time, and runtime memory consumption across the deep learning architectures (MLP, 1D CNN, 2D CNN, and LSTM) by decreasing the feature space from 30 samples down to 20, 15, and 5 samples.</li>
